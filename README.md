# AdventOfCode23

My solutions to the Advent of Code 2023.

The aim is to solve the problems as quickly and accurately as possible, not produce production quality code! My goal is to spend 30 minutes per task (well, at least until we get to the really difficult ones), and submit no wrong answers. DO NOT code like this in real scenarios :)

Note also that everyone gets different data (other than the examples) so don't rely on any of the answers you see generated by my data.
